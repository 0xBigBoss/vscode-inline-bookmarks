# Inline Bookmarks

<img width="350" alt="inline_bookmarks_icon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2865694/69679883-91366500-10a9-11ea-8e36-ba3e799127b3.png">

Code navigation for inline bookmarks made easy.

* Specify words inside your documents that are highlighted as bookmarks in the IDE. 
* Easily navigate to bookmarks from the **Inline Bookmarks View** added to the Explorer Panel. 

Other extensions allow you to set bookmarks with some clicks in the IDE. With Inline Bookmarks you specify custom trigger words inside your documents that are automatically turned into VSCode Bookmarks. They will show up with a customizable gutter icon next to the code lines and are highlighted within the code. Decorations can be customized. An **Inline Bookmarks** View in the Explorer Panel helps you keep track of all your bookmarks. Navigating to the bookmark location is as easy as clicking on an item in the view.

The extension can be used to keep track of development notes and todo's, for document review, as well as log analysis and auditing purposes. Since bookmarks are stored with your documents you can easily share your notes and bookmarks with others.

* apply custom filter to bookmarks view with command `inlineBookmarks.setTreeViewFilterWords`.
  * empty list unsets filter
  * takes space- or semicolon-delimited list of regular expressions applied on the items label.

## Expert

* reset the internal bookmarks state: `inlineBookmarks.debug.state.reset`
  * bookmarks view is populated when files containing bookmarks are openend in the editor
* go to the extension settings: `code ‚Üí preferences ‚Üí Extensions: Inline Bookmarks`
* Exceptions
  * configure file-extensions to be exempt from decoration
  * configure temporary overrides for trigger words to be exempt from decoration (matches begin of word)
* Custom Styles
  * be aware that existing styles can be overridden

* Custom word mappings
  * You can assign multiple regex trigger words to a decoration style. See example below.
